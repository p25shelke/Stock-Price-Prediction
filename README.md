# Stock-Price-Prediction
## Problems Statement:

In this project we want to predict the closing price for Apple Inc.
The data ranges from '2015-05-07' till '2020-05-22' having 1257 no. of records where where our target variable will be stock closing price

## Preprocessing
we have done feature scalling using min max scaler for our target variable

we have also split the data at 65% Interval   

## Creating stacked LSTM Model

In this we have used stacked LSTM model.

Loss on training: 1.3457e-04

Loss on testing: 9.6410e-04

Mean Square error on testing 235

Mean Square error on training 141

## Predicting the test data and plotting the output

In this we have predicted on the test data and plot the data

## Predicting 30 day output and ploting the output
